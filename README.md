the code for the layout of this app can be found here... http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_blog&stacked=h

This app uses the Blog template and fills out the backend with Rails.
For the most part, it looks the same and it was fun to try and make it work like a normal website.
