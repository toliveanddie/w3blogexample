the code for the layout of this app can be found here... http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_temp_blog&stacked=h

This app uses the Blog template from the w3schools.com Bootstrap tutorial in the link above.
I accepted the challenge to make the template work for real !!  with a rails backend !!
Except for the navbar links and some pictures that were omitted, it looks pretty much the same with some rails tweaks added in.
it was fun!
